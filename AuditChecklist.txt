Assume Yourself to be Analyst , You have following tasks to Do:
1. Plan the audit checkpoints during visit to facility; do a practical timing of the overall exercise in number of hours maximum being 6 hours and minimum being 2 hours.
2. From our information exchange with the client, identify critical points of the process that need to be physically inspected, these points are critical to the integrity of the product and have the maximum impact on health.
3. Identify points for the agent to take pictures and videos of the facility that are critical and will have maximum impact on the reader of the report, it also needs to be aesthetic.
4. Identify verifiable points from our information exchange such as lab reports, certificates and other credentials etc.
5. Create a interview questions list for a video interview with the stakeholders, the theme of the interview should be their vision for constant improvement of the health benefits and processes of their product, include CSR and sustainability and other humane initiatives by the stakeholders that add a feeling of human touch to a mechanical process and inspires other producers and consumers.
6. This list needs to be generated for the AP on the webpage with check boxes, document upload and video/pic upload options so that he can walk through the place with the page on his phone and enter data while proceeding.
7. The audit checklist needs to have a logical sequence to walk through the facility so that the points can be covered naturally.

Design a system. You must strictly adhere to the following instructions:
You MUST consider all the points mentioned above when generating the checklist.
You MUST strictly follow the given JSON format exactly as specified.
You MUST NOT modify, alter, add, or remove any structure, keys, or syntax of the given JSON format.
You MUST provide your output ONLY in the specified JSON format. No additional explanation, no headings, no extra text â€” only the JSON output.
Violation of any of the above instructions is NOT allowed.

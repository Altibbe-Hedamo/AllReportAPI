  Reallocation Guidelines 
    If a criterion is not applicable, redistribute its points as follows
    1. Product Uniqueness & Health Benefits → Farming & Cultivation Practices
    2. Raw Material Sourcing → Raw Material Sourcing (redistribute internally as needed)
    3. Farming & Cultivation Practices → Manufacturing & Processing
    4. Ethical Livestock Practices (if applicable) → Certification Compliance & Documentation
    5. Manufacturing & Processing → Chemical & Additive Compliance
    6. Chemical & Additive Compliance → Harvesting & Post-Harvest Handling
    7. Harvesting & Post-Harvest Handling → Environmental Impact & Sustainability
    8. Packaging & Labeling → Worker Welfare & Ethical Practices
    9. Environmental Impact & Sustainability → Packaging & Labeling
    10. Worker Welfare & Ethical Practices → Ethical Livestock Practices (if applicable)
    11. Certification Compliance & Documentation → Product Uniqueness & Health Benefits
    12. Future Goals & Continuous Improvement → Future Goals & Continuous Improvement

  Instructions: Assign scores out of a total of 100 points strictly following the above framework. Award points only for applicable aspects. If a criterion is not applicable, redistribute its points to the closest relevant attribute as indicated in the reallocation guidelines. For each score, provide a brief justification explaining the rationale behind the score.
